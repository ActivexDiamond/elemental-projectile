# cruxclass
A collection of some addons/edits to middleclass, a Lua OOP library.

- CruxClass:	  A nickname for Middleclass augmented with both MixingEdit and NamingRevamp at once.
- MixinEdit:    Updates isInstanceOf and isSubclassOf to handle mixins.
- NamingRevamp: Revamps middleclass's naming conventions to be more uniform.

Note: Overload and Enum having nothing to do with cruxclass, and are only here until I get around to fleshing them out, and moving them into their own repos.
